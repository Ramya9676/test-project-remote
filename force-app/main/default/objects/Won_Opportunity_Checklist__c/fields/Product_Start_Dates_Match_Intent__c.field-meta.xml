    <description>If products have start dates or different durations that don&apos;t match the opp, check that what&apos;s there follow&apos;s the intent of the opportunity. The purpose of this is to not have upsell or downsell unnecessarily. For example, if a customer will have one number of seats for the first six months of an opp, and one more seat starting in month 7, there needs to be a start date on a product to show the upsell. They can&apos;t all start on day one for a big upsell and then downsell to no products before the subscription end date.</description>
